            Hi, I'm Brandon and I'm a media arts student from the School of Interactive Arts & Technology at Simon Fraser University. I love to communicate ideas visually through video and motion graphics, engaging the viewer as much as I can while peaking their interest as they watch through videos. For me, the best tool for educating is visual representation; and that's why I want to find new ways to educate people on different aspects of a concept. I'm also a big fan of video games, exercise, and Marvel.

        </p>

        <p>My selection for the first of two process analyses is a project I did for a friend's family business in February 2019. The business is a flooring store that specializes in the retail of natural stone and tile flooring. This was my first project that gave me the opportunity to plan out and shoot independently, so this is one of my proudest projects to date. Initially, I had approached my friend a year prior to the actual shoot but fell out of touch. Once we had scheduled a date, I brainstormed some questions to ask her about what her family's business does, what they strive to accomplish, and what customers can expect when they stop by the location. Below is the list of questions that were presented a week prior to the shoot. </p>

        <ol>
            <b>
                <li>What is Paradigm Surfaces?</li>
                <li>What does Paradigm strive to accomplish?</li>
                <li>What do you wish to achieve when speaking with customers?</li>
                <li>What process do you go through when recommending floors/tiles?</li>
                <li>What makes you unique compared to other flooring stores?</li>
                <li>What else should people know?</li>
            </b>
        </ol>

        <p>On my initial visit, I scouted a location within the store that would suit the framing of the interview, and found the front desk most appropriate. On the day of the shoot I had already planned what shots I was going to use based on experience from past projects. This is also why I did not create a storyboard, as interviews typically consist of b-roll that is captured on site. </p>

        <p>After shooting was complete, it took me several days to finish the entire video from pre-production to post production. This opportunity really let me build on my leadership skills as I was able to fully control how the video was going to turn out.</p>

        <h3>Kintec: Footwear & Orthotics - Lower Back Pain</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="col-50">
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_SUTO7QGYs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>My recent co-op experience at Kintec: Footwear and Orthotics provided me with valuable experience that has boosted my communication skills and ability to work on team-oriented projects. My most notable project was a lower back pain video that helps those suffering with soreness in combating the symptoms to alleviate stress and tension to live a healthier and more enjoyable life.</p>

        <p>I first began by reviewing the script the Social Media Coordinator had compiled that the pedorthist would be reading and familiarized myself with the different components that contribute to lower back pain. I then brought my thoughts up on what to do in the video to my supervisor and marketing team members. From there, it was a matter of filming the video and obtaining the footage. I had worked with this pedorthist before and he spoke slowly, so it was a challenge for me to keep him on pace in order to keep the length of the video as short as possible.</p>

        <p>After the video was filmed, one of the more enjoyable parts of the project was to include animations of symbols and text to portray the points more effectively. This was done while I was also working on sequencing and colour correction. After several iterations, the video was approved by my supervisor and the video was published. For me, this was one of the projects that allowed me to portray most of my skills and I am happy with how it turned out.</p>
